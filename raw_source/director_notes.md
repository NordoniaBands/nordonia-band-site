	5	Our Ensembles
 Marching Band
The Nordonia High School Marching Band is a Class AA competitive ensemble that performs at OMEA marching band events throughout the fall. The band brings energy and spirit to football games, community events, and competitions. Students develop strong musicianship, leadership skills, and teamwork through a rigorous and rewarding performance season. Our marching band program emphasizes excellence both on and off the field, fostering pride in our school and community.
 Jazz Bands
Our jazz program begins at Nordonia Middle School, where students can participate in curricular jazz band classes in both 7th and 8th grade. At the high school level, we offer a curricular Jazz Band where students explore classic and contemporary jazz literature. Members of the jazz ensembles learn improvisation, jazz theory, and styles ranging from swing to Latin and funk. Our jazz program provides frequent performance opportunities at concerts and local events.
 Concert Bands
At Nordonia Middle School, students participate in 7th Grade Band and 8th Grade Band, building foundational skills that prepare them for success in high school ensembles.
The concert band program features two primary ensembles at Nordonia High School:
	•	Wind Ensemble (Class A/AA): Our premier concert group, performing advanced wind literature and regularly participating in OMEA adjudicated events.
	•	Concert Band (Class C): This ensemble offers students opportunities to grow their musicianship and perform a variety of repertoire in concert settings. Both bands perform at seasonal concerts and competitions, showcasing the hard work and musical growth of our students. 
 Chamber Ensembles
Students have opportunities to perform in small chamber ensembles, such as woodwind ensembles, brass choirs, percussion ensembles, and more. These groups allow students to explore more intimate and challenging repertoire, develop their individual musicianship, and collaborate in a more personal setting. Chamber groups often perform at school concerts, community events, and OMEA Solo & Ensemble Adjudicated Events.
 Indoor Percussion
Our Indoor Percussion Ensemble is an extension of the marching percussion program and provides students with a competitive and educational experience during the winter and spring months. The ensemble focuses on developing advanced percussion techniques in both battery and front ensemble instrumentation. Indoor percussion competes in local circuits and provides additional performance opportunities beyond the fall marching season.
Indoor Color Guard
The Nordonia Winter Guard program continues the artistry and athleticism of color guard during the winter and spring seasons. Students develop skills in dance, flag, rifle, and sabre work while performing dynamic and expressive shows in competitive circuits. The winter guard program fosters creativity, teamwork, and precision, offering students a unique and rewarding performance experience outside of the fall marching band season.
